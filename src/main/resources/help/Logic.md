## Connections

This experiment requires either the discrete 2-1 X 8 AHaH Node adapter boards or 2-1 X 7 AHaH Node chips.

### Method 1: Discrete Adapter Board

The discrete 2-1 X 8 AHaH Node adapter board can be used to form 8 distinct 2-1 synapses from 2, 4 or 6 discrete memristor chips. To use the adapter board, remove all jumpers and plug the adapter board in over the dip socket.

### Method 2: 2-1 X 7 AHaH Node chips

Removed the shown jumpers and wire to the "Y" node. Note that only synapse 1-7 are functional.

## Input A and B mask selection


## Series Resistors

Use the jumpers on the right to select the series resistor and route it to ground. The default series resistor is 1kÎ©. If you change this, be sure that you change this in the preferences as well.

## Controls

The control panel can be used to adjust the driver waveform, pulse width and 




## Exporting Data

Any plot can be right-clicked to export the data in either chart format (save As...) or comma-separated-values (Export As...), which can be opened in spreadsheet software. For "Export As..." a directory needs to be selected. In that directory, an individual CSV file will be created for each series in the plot.

## Preferences

The preferences window allows you to save your preferred experimental control parameters between sessions of using the app.
