# Synapse App

This app allows you to drive a 2-1 synapse with base kT-RAM instructions and observe a continuous response in synaptic conductances via repeated `FFLV` instructions. It does this by measuring the voltage drops across the two memristors and the series resistor. 

## Connections

1. The jumper on the left side of memristor #1 connects to node `A`.
1. The jumper on the right side of memristor #2 connects to node `B`.
1. A jumper cable connects the right side of memristor #1 with node `Y`.
1. A jumper cable connects the left side of memristor #2 with node `Y`.

## Memristor Selection

Use the toggle switches near the top of the app window to connect the two individual memristors wired as a synapse into the circuit.

## Series Resistors

Use the jumpers on the right to select the series resistor and route it to ground. The default series resistor is 1kÎ©. If you change this, be sure that you change this in the preferences as well.

## Controls

The control panel can be used to adjust the driver waveform and pulse width. 


## Exporting Data

Any plot can be right-clicked to export the data in either chart format (save As...) or comma-separated-values (Export As...), which can be opened in spreadsheet software. For "Export As..." a directory needs to be selected. In that directory, an individual CSV file will be created for each series in the plot.

## Preferences

The preferences window allows you to save your preferred experimental control parameters between sessions of using the app.
